#' knitLatex: Latex table helpers for knitr.
#'
#' This package was inspired by the xtable package, but allows for more
#' fine_grained control, especially in regards to the longtable and supertabular
#' (which is not included in xtable) environments. This package provides three
#' main functions to assist in using knitr with latex:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item xTab: which creates a basic latex table environment.
#'   \item lTab: which creates a longtable evironment.
#'   \item sTab: creates a supertabular environment.
#' }
