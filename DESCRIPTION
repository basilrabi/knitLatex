Package: knitLatex
Title: knitr helpers - mostly tables
Version: 0.9.0
Authors@R: person("John", "Shea", email = "coachshea@fastmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides several helper functions for working with knitr and latex.
  It includes xTab for creating traditional latex tables, lTab for generating
  longtable environments, and sTab for generating a supertabular environment.
  Additionally, this package contains a knitr_setup() function which fixes a
  well-known bug in knitr, which distorts the 'results="asis"' command when used
  in conjunction with user-defined commands; and a com command (<<com=TRUE>>=)
  which renders the output from knitr as a latex command.
