Title: knitr helpers - mostly tables
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("John", "Shea", email = "coachshea@fastmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package includes several helper functions for working with
  knitr and latex. It includes xTAb for creating traditional latex tables. lTab
  for generating Longtable environments; and sTab for generating a Supertabular
  environment. Additionally, this package contains a knitr_setup() function
  which fixes a known bug which distorts the 'results="asis"' command when used
  in conjunction with userdifiend commands; and a com command (<<com=TRUE>>=)
  which renders the output from knitr as a latex command.
